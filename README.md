simulates reflected fractional Brownian motion in two-dimensional and three-dimensional brain shaped domains

The code in this project simulates reflected fractional Brownian motion (FBM) in complex two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometries. It was developed to simulate the spatial distribution of serotonergic neuros in vertebrate brains, see  [Front. Comput. Neurosci. 14, 56 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2020.00056) and [Front. Comput. Neurosci. 17, 1189853 (2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2023.1189853). It should be easy to adapt to other problems by modifying the files that describe the geometry (see below).
