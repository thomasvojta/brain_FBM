# brain_FBM
simulates reflected fractional Brownian motion in two-dimensional and three-dimensional brain shaped domains

The code in this project simulates reflected fractional Brownian motion (FBM) in complex two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometries. It was developed to simulate the spatial distribution of serotonergic neuros in vertebrate brains. It should be easy to adapt to other problems by modifying the files that describe the geometry (see below).
